A New Venture 

   I will begin this blog post by saying that it is hard to truly analyze why we decide to do the things that we do! as humans we always seek for validation in the things that are guaranteed. In my case It took me three years to finally know what I wanted to do with my life. I grew up in Chicago my whole life, about three years ago I decided I wanted a fresh start. I packed two bags with as much clothes as I could fit, and bought a one way ticket to New York. Hands Down one of the craziest things I have ever done. Within these years in New york I have been a florist. I love being able to create, and make something beautiful out of nothing. 
	 Which leads me to why took this opportunity to become a Software Developer. The idea of being able to challenge myself every day, the idea of learning something new, the idea of being surrounded by so many different people from different backgrounds coming together to create something. Fascinates me. This first mile was challenging! mostly because I don't have a background in Software Development, but one thing I truly believe in is that we are capable of learning anything that we want if we apply ourselves. This venture will be difficult, and it will be challenging, but I am looking forward to seeing the light in the end of tunnel.
