I`ve had a few jobs in the process of figuring out what my "calling" is, and about a few months ago I came to the realization that I love to create, and solve problems.  That maybe a calling could go hand in hand with a career. I do admit that beginning this course has been challenging! it is a skill that requires alot of attention, and patience, but once you get that code running its the most satifying feeling. I am extremely excited to see what other challenges will be presented to me through this course, and what other functions will come in to practice to make my program run smoothly. 


Another reason why I decided to study Software Engineering is because of the world we are currently living in! everything is technology. From the apps we use, to the functionalities our phones have. It`s awesome knowing that we are able to create a whole other world through code. its an art.
